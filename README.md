# CAPTURE THE FLAG CHALLENGE
##### Ctf difficulty level: EASY

The following are some indications for how best to carry out the challenge:
- The ctf consists of finding the FLAG within the provided executable file.
- Actually we provided a compiled file for Linux. 
- It's possibile that Windows will detect the executable file as a virus file (it's a file full of bad code in order to allow you to complete the challenge,but obviously harmless), so just turn off yout windows defender (and yourantivirus too if you have one) until you downloaded the file and you completed the ctf.
- The flag has a form equal to “FLAG: ... ”.
- Maybe there is more than one flag to find...
- There is a vulnerability deliberately inserted in the code, which makes it possible to get the FLAG(s).
