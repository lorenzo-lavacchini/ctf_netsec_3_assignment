# CAPTURE THE FLAG CHALLENGE
##### Ctf difficulty level: EASY

The following are some indications for how best to carry out the challenge:
- The ctf consists of finding the FLAG within the provided executable file.
- We provided a compiled file for Linux (elf).
- If you have troubles trying to execute it, it should be a permission problem. Look in the properties for the executable file, and check the permissions of the file. In particular look for the checkbox "Executable as a Program": it must be abilitated.
- The flag has a form equal to “FLAG: ... ”.
- Maybe there is more than one flag to find...
- There is a vulnerability deliberately inserted in the code, which makes it possible to get the FLAG(s).

##### Hint
- Underlying program is written in C, and the vulnerability is well known.
- Try to enter finding the password (password is 10 characters long).
